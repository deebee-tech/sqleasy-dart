# Changelog

## 0.1.1

- Docs: correct the README, which still described the package as a work in progress after the port
  was already complete. No code changes.

## 0.1.0

First release. A complete Dart port of [`@deebeetech/sqleasy`](https://github.com/deebee-tech/sqleasy),
held to that implementation byte-for-byte by a shared golden corpus.

- **Pure Dart** — no Flutter SDK dependency, no `dart:io`, no `dart:html`. Runs on Flutter mobile,
  desktop and web, and on plain Dart servers.
- **Four dialects** — Postgres, MySQL, SQL Server, and SQLite, each with correct identifier quoting,
  placeholder style, default schema, and transaction wrappers.
- **Fluent builder** — SELECT / INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE, plus joins, groups, subqueries, CTEs,
  unions, and batched transactions. Every mutator returns the builder, so chaining and cascades both
  work. `parsePrepared()` hands you the SQL string and its ordered bound parameters.
- **Idiomatic API** — named/optional parameters instead of empty-string sentinels, Dart 3 records for
  batch methods, `Object?` value slots.
- **Verified against the corpus** — all 189 golden cases replayed across all four dialects, passing
  on the Dart VM *and* under dart2js. That cross-platform equality is what guarantees the package
  emits identical SQL on Flutter mobile and Flutter web; see `goldens/README.md`.
